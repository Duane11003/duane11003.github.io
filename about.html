					<p class="about">
					<span class="about">I'm a New York based graphic designer, 
					currently working in an in-house marketing department.</span></p>

					<p class="about">New experiences and challenges are my thing. I strive to have a "clean" look with my work (Keep It Simple Stupid). If you have any cool and interesting projects for me, get in touch! 
					</p>

					<p class="about">
					I received my bachelors in 2006 from Fairleigh Dickinson University. After 2 years of freelance and temporary gigs, I landed my first job-job in 2008 as a designer in Brooklyn. It's been an interesting ride filled with last-minute deadlines, the occassional difficult client, and I can't wait to see what the next decade holds.
